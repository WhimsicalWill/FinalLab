    "Our data driven conclusion I think did a great job in taking the a lot of information, and boiling them down into general metrics, that when combined really represents a summary of what the best Neighborhood of Pittsburgh is. We wanted to choose completely different metrics that represent completely different aspects of what goes into a good neighborhood. This way we are working with data from a variety of places. Our Housing data, Enviromental Data, and Financial data when combined provide a quick overview of many different factors given. In terms of weighting which factors are the most important, we took a more unorthodox approach. Like stated earlier the housing data was used a \"weed out\" metric meaning that if a Neighborhood did not have a perfect rating in terms of housing then it is not in contention for best Neighborhood. We weighted this as the most important because this standard was relatively easy for a Neighborhood to pass, so a Neighborhood not passing it speaks a lot to the government and management of that Neighborhood. The Enviromental and Financial Ratings were rating evenly. We were able to identify one Neighborhood that was among the top finishers in both metrics making it an easy choice to decide which Neighborhood was the best. All in all I think that our metrics provided a very good estimate of the best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh. "
